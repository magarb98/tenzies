# tenzies

Simple game that requires user to roll dice until all the values are the same. Individual dice can be 'held' so their
values do not change in the next roll. Custom node modules such as react-confetti used to add extra features. Die faces 
displayed by using svg files imported from the fontawesome npm package.
